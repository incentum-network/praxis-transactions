### Token Use Clause for Praxis Smart Contracts, Praxis, and Incentum Components

1. You must abide by one of the following:
   1. You must use the PRAX token directly in your network to pay the gas fees, or
   2. By acquiring an equivalent amount of PRAX (from anywhere).
2. You cannot modify any of the calculations that determine the gas fees, or that allow access to the gas fee usage.

#### Notes for acquiring PRAX

The second case of 1 above "By acquiring an equivalent amount of PRAX..." may sound odd at first glance because you keep the PRAX that you
acquire, but it increases the demand for PRAX in the same way as if you used it directly.

This gives you the flexibility of not having to use PRAX directly anywhere in your network, as long as you acquire the equivalent amount (to the gas fees) in some other way.

The exact mechanism for acquiring PRAX is not described here.
